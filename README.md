# ATM-fraud-Detection
Description:

Developed a predictive model using machine learning techniques to forecast ATM transaction volumes based on historical data.
Utilized Python programming language and libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data preprocessing, model building, and visualization.
Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in ATM usage data, ensuring robust feature selection.
Engineered relevant features such as time of day, day of week, and seasonal trends to improve model accuracy.
Implemented a variety of machine learning algorithms including regression, time series analysis, and ensemble methods to predict future transaction volumes.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), achieving [insert performance metric here]% accuracy.
Collaborated with stakeholders from banking operations and IT departments to understand business requirements and ensure alignment with project goals.
Presented project findings and recommendations to senior management, highlighting opportunities for improved resource allocation and operational efficiency.
Successfully deployed the predictive model into production, contributing to proactive ATM maintenance scheduling and enhanced customer satisfaction.
